Why learn Bootstrap?

If you want to quickly create a website without writing tons of CSS from scratch, then Bootstrap 4 might be the framework you’re looking for. In this course, you’ll see how Bootstrap makes it easy to layout and create interactive and responsive sites.

Take-Away Skills:

You’ll learn about Bootstrap’s grid system to construct complex layouts. Then, you’ll style and populate your site using Bootstrap’s utility classes and components. With Bootstrap, HTML, some familiarity with CSS, and JavaScript, you’ll be making websites in no time.

Note on Prerequisites:

A basic understanding of HTML is required to start learning Bootstrap. Some familiarity with how CSS works (CSS Selectors and Visual Rules) would be helpful, but is not required.
