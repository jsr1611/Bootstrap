### LEARN BOOTSTRAP 4: UTILITIES AND COMPONENTS

#### Element Positioning
When considering the layout of a webpage, we have to think about how to position our elements. Conveniently, Bootstrap provides positioning utility classes.

We can apply CSS positioning styling by assigning an element a utility class found in Bootstrap’s positioning documentation. It would also be worth knowing how these position are rendered on a webpage.

For example, if we want an element that is fixed to the top, we can apply a "fixed-top" class:

```
<div class="fixed-top">
  This div will be fixed at the top of the screen. 
</div>
```
There are a few other positioning utility classes, so let’s explore how to use them!

### Instructions
1. In index.html, there is an ```<h1>``` element that we want to stick to the top. Look up what class to add to the ```<h1>``` at Bootstrap’s positioning documentation.


2. Now the ```<h1>``` element should stick to the top even after we’ve scrolled past it.
Let’s also fix the <footer> to the bottom of the page using a Bootstrap utility class. You’ll have to scroll to the bottom of index.html to find the <footer> element.
