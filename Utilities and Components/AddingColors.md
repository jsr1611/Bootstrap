Instructions
1.
Change the text color of the <p> element to yellow by assigning its class a value of "text-warning".


2.
Under the <p> element, there is a <div> element. Change the background color of the <div> element to teal by adding a class of "bg-info".


3.
Locate the last unstyled <div> element and change the background color to green and the text color to white.

You’ll need to browse Bootstrap’s colors documentation to know which two classes to add!
