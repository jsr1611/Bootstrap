### LEARN BOOTSTRAP 4: UTILITIES AND COMPONENTS
### The Jumbotron Component
In arenas and stadiums, there are giant screens called jumbotrons which display the main event for everyone in the crowd to see. Bootstrap also offers a jumbotron component that serves a similar function and makes content stand out.

Here’s an example of a basic jumbotron that only contains text:

```
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1>Wow this stands out!</h1>
</div>
```
In the example above we included an ```<h1>``` element, but we could add images or a variety of Bootstrap components. Look over [Bootstrap’s jumbotron documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/jumbotron) for more elaborate examples.

### Instructions
1. Use the comments to locate where you’ll put the jumbotron component.
Inside the column of that row, add a ```<div>``` and assign it a class of ```"jumbotron"```.

2.Inside the jumbotron, add some content relevant to Gloria’s Gardening! It can be anything you want, just make sure it’s not blank!
